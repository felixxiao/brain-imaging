(Notes for Kevin himself so I don't forget.
I'll slowly introduce these over time so it's not overwhelming)

- Get other brain parcellations to compare against
- Shuffle the dcor values you found to generate random parcellations
- Make a super source_header outside all the folder and have each
  folder's individual source_header call upon it (or something. We
  really only need one source_header)
- Add hooks to check tests whenever you push
- Do extensive testing
- Make the plotter for the parcellation
- Get another brain ready so we have at least 2 brains to run on
