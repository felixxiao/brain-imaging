Table (\ref{8_methods}) summarizes the objectives, advantages, and
drawbacks of each partitioning method we've presented in the previous
chapters. Clearly, the requirement of parcels to be connected components
is the biggest roadblock to developing a good method.

There is a post-processing method that can take a parcellation with
disconnected components and modify it to be connected. The method is to
treat each separate component of a parcel as new parcels, create a
Contractible Graph with these new parcels as components, and apply the
(Generalized) Edge Contract algorithm. This was carried out as a
post-processing step in the spectral and SymBMF parcellations, detailed
in the next section.

The second limiting factor is computational time. The Alternating
Nonnegative Least Squares algorithm can be made to work on graphs as
large as the brain, but this would require some specialized data
structures for the computation of $X$ and $Y$ to avoid re-computing
unchanged columns. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to
implement this.

The problem of computational time is most evident in the integer (and
linear) programming methods. The fact that our brain data was too large
for even the lightest linear program shows that this generic optimization
approach is typically not feasible. However, these proposed methods may
be of use to problems with smaller data sets.

One possible approach to dealing with computational time that we have not
had the time to explore is to apply the MIP methods to small subgraphs
of the brain. For instance, one could take the AAL parcellation and
obtain a finer parcellation by using a MIP method on each of the AAL
parcels.

All of the methods above can be applied to the similar problem of
\textit{clustering}. In fact, similarity-based clustering is just a
special case of graph partitioning where the graph is fully connected
(i.e., every vertex has an edge to every other vertex), so connectedness
of partitions is no longer a relevant factor. Then, if we define the
Adjacent-Score in terms of similarity equal to negative Euclidean
distance squared:
\[ \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K \frac{1}{{|V_k| \choose 2}}
   \sum_{x,y \in V_k} - \|x - y\|^2 \]
the objective of maximizing Adjacent-Score becomes equivalent to 
minimizing a weighted within-cluster sum of squares objective
\[ \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{1}{{|V_k| \choose 2}}
   \sum_{x \in V_k} \|x - \mu_k\|^2 \]
where $\mu_k$ is the mean of all $x$ in $V_k$.

\label{autism}
\begin{tabular}{l | r r r r r r}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Tables (\ref{normal}) and (\ref{autism}) respectively show the results
of various parcellation methods carried out on resting state fMRI scans
of 6 control and 6 autism patients. For each method and criterion,
the values are averaged over the six subjects in each cohort.

In both groups, the Generalized Edge-Contract with parameters
$\alpha = 6$ and $\beta = 4$ performed best.

The mean ARI between autistic and control brains is not significantly
different from the mean ARI between brains of the same cohort, at the
116-parcel level.
