We formulate the task of brain parcellation (dividing the
brain into functionally homogenous regions) as a graph
partitioning problem. We devise new model-free criteria
for validating parcellations based on statistical
dependency between parcels using distance correlation.
Based off our criteria we pose a new graph cut-type
problem called Max Average Within Edge (MAWE), wherein the
objective is to maximize the sum for each component, of
the average weight of all edges with both endpoints in the
component.

In chapter 4, we propose a family of heuristic algorithms
based on a new Contractible Graph data structure for
attaining good solutions for MAWE and give the results
of these algorithms on a resting state fMRI scan.

In chapter 5 we explore the well-established spectral
ratio-cut minimization technique and measure its
performance in MAWE on the same data set.

In chapter 6 we do the same for the more recently proposed
nonnegative adjacency matrix factorization method,
an alternative to spectral partitioning.

In chapter 7 we show that the MAWE problem can be
reduced to a special instance of generalized 0-1
fractional programming which has an mixed integer programming
equivalent.

Chapter 8 presents the results of these partitioning methods
on 12 autism and control fMRI scans.
