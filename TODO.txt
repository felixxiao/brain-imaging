(Notes for Kevin himself so I don't forget.
I'll slowly introduce these over time so it's not overwhelming)

- Get other brain parcellations to compare against
- Shuffle the dcor values you found to generate random parcellations
- Add hooks to check tests whenever you push
- Do extensive testing
- Get another brain ready so we have at least 2 brains to run on
- parallel computing (foreach and DoMC)
- TIGER account
- Show iPython using R
- Split data into data and results
- Fix the way we do sourcing to follow Felix's procedure
- add testing for union find
- make sure we keep the readme up to date
